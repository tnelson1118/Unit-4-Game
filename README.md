# Unit-4-Game

This assigment seemed easier than last.

the user loads the page.
the game doesnt start until the user clicks a gem.
once clicked, the number to hit is populated as well as the gem value of the first gem you had clicked
the player is suppose to try and hit exactly on the number to hit by clicking on the gems.
the gem values show once the gem is clicked and then goes away when they click anther.
if they win, the game starts again once they click a gem again and their win count goes up by one.
if they go over and loser, the game starts again once the next gem is clicked and their loss count goes up.
and new number to hit is generated everytime the game restarts.
